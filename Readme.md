# Economic Factors Affecting Unemployment: A Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes how different economic factors influence unemployment rates across the United States, India, and China from 2000 to 2023. It includes data visualization, correlation analysis, and future predictions using machine learning models.

## Key Findings

### Economic Relationships
- When inflation decreases, unemployment typically increases
- Lower interest rates generally lead to changes in the trade balance
- Tax revenue impacts GDP growth through government spending capabilities
- GDP growth and inflation rates are the most crucial factors affecting unemployment

### Country-Specific Insights
- **India**: Saw increased agricultural employment after 2019, partly due to government support programs
- **China**: Experienced a significant decrease in agricultural employment due to urbanization
- **USA**: Showed relatively stable employment across industries

## Data Sources
The analysis uses data from various economic indicators:
- Unemployment rates
- GDP growth
- Inflation rates
- Interest rates
- Trade balance
- Tax revenue
- Population data
- Employment by sector (Agriculture, Industry, Services)
- Education statistics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries:
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib and Plotly for visualization
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning
  - TensorFlow for LSTM modeling
  - Seaborn for statistical visualization
  - Statsmodels for time series analysis

## Predictions
The project includes future predictions (2024-2028) using:
- SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) model
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks

### Model Comparison for 2024 Predictions
LSTM showed better accuracy when compared with actual 2024 data:
- More accurate unemployment predictions for all three countries
- Better alignment with real-world economic trends

## Key Conclusions
1. Unemployment rates are heavily influenced by inflation and GDP growth
2. Stable inflation and interest rates are crucial for reducing unemployment
3. Each country shows unique patterns based on their economic policies
4. Machine learning models can provide reasonable predictions for future trends
